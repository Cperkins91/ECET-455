/*
 * . Create a structure called employee that contains two members: an employee number
(type int) and the employeeâ€™s compensation (in dollars; type float). Ask the user to fill
in this data for three employees, store it in three variables of type struct employee, and
then display the information for each employee.
 */

/*
 * I had planned on using a while loop and a switch statement to iterate through the employees. I was having trouble getting the switch
 * statement to work and was running short on time. Hopefully I can return and fix this so that is isn't so repetetive!
